# Ice-Cold-Beer-Game

## Summary
  This project aims to virtually create a 2d game based off of an older game called Ice Cold Beer.
  It was a game where you used two joysticks to slowly move a ball past these holes until you can get it into a hole that's lit up.
  The ball and bar return to the bottom of the playfield, and the next target hole is lit.
