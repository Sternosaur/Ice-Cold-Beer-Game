# Mountain Climber

## Summary
  This project aims to virtually create a 2d game based off of an older game called Ice Cold Beer.
  It was a game where you used two joysticks to slowly move a ball past these holes until you can get it into a hole that's lit up.
  The ball and bar return to the bottom of the playfield, and the next target hole is lit.  This project will be made on
  Unity version 2019.1.10.  I've included my brainstorming and the project design document below.
