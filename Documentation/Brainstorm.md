1. We want to come up with a mouse and keyboard control scheme for players without gamepads!
1. Could this work as a mobile game?  What would the controls be?
1. How can I customize the theme?  My game will not be about ice cold beer.
1. David wants us to first make a playable prototype as our top priority before getting carried away with art, story, etc.
