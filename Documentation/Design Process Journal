We made a physical prototype of the ramp and decided it will move along with two underlying objects kind of like as helf.
We know the shelf will have to eventually be fastened to the underlying objects otherwise it will slide off.
No matter our solution to the slide-off problem, we need to create objects that move up and down along with player input.
The first step is to just make one object that moves up and down with player input.
## What button should it be?
We know we're developing on mouse and keyboard, so no matter what platform we ultimately release teh game on (PC, XBOX, Mobile, ios, etc), we have to have keyboard controls so that we can test the game as we develop it on PC.
Commonly games use WASD, or the arrow keys, so we could use WS for the left object and we could use up and down for the right.
In the interest of moving forward with development, we're just going to start with off with this.
