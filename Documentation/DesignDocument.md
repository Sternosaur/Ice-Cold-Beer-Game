# Mountain Climber

- ## Overview
  *Mountain  Climber* is a single player, dexterity-based game for PC heavy inspired by [Ice Cold Beer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po6beHThvfw).
- ## Objectives
  The player must scale their way up the mountain in search for treasure, using their balance to navigate around bear infested caves.
  - The player must carefully **move both sides** of a **bar**.
  - **Avoid** rolling the ball into any **unlit holes**.
  - **Roll** the **ball into** the **lit hole** in order to progress to the next hole.
- ## Gameplay
  The player will **control** their character through two directional inputs on a **keyboard** or a **controller**.
  The player can move the bar on both sides up and down, which will roll the ball back and fourth against
  a solid background filled with many holes.

  *More points* are added to the player's score the *faster they reach the treasure.*  If the player *goes into the wrong cave*, they will   be eaten by a bear and *lose a life*. The player has a **score counter** and a **life counter**.
  If the player manages to *score enough points*, they will *earn an extra life*.
- ## Player Character
  The player character is a mountain climber who's working their way up the mountain to explore the caves for treasure.  No physical details are given about the character, allowing players to role play and make up their own assumptions about the character's demographic.
