(I would like to find a way to use this background as I really love the asthetic of of these mountains.)

## Summary

After I found the assets I was interested in using, I tested a quick mockup of how some of the game assets would look when they were put together in paint.net.
I was content with the pattern of the background, but I wasn't happy with the color, so I changed the color.
For my player, I didn't require the motion trail behind the ball, so I removed that as well.
Finally, I needed holes for my ball, so I took the original ball and gave it a dark hole and a light hole.  I shrunk down the ball by 20% so that in theory, it should be able to easily fit in.
I'm undecided on using walls in my game, but if I had to use walls, I feel like I could achive the desired effect by changing up the color and position of the ramp in order to produce them.
