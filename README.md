# Ice-Cold-Beer-Game
Repository for Intro to Game Dev Project 1
This project aims to virtually create a 2d game based off of an older game called Ice Cold Beer.
It was a game where you used two joysticks to slowly move a ball past these holes until you can get it into a hole that's lit up.
The ball and bar return to the bottom of the playfield, and the next target hole is lit.
Please join me as I go through the process of learning how to create a game similar to this through Unity.  :)
